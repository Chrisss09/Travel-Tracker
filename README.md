# Travel Tracker

This is my 3rd project for Data Centric Development, I have chosen to use Bootstrap 4 to structure my app.
This is a website to share and review your holiday experiences or you can plan where you are going to go in the future.

The user's can create, read, and share information. When the user logs into the site they can view other user's reviews - just like a trip advisor.

## **UX**

This website was made for people that like to travel and go on holiday. I have created this website so that people can create, read, update, and delete information.

The website can be used as a planner and a website to review countries. The user can add times and dates of flights, and plan key attractions on where they would like to go. You can also go back to your post and review it or you can add a new post for a country you have already been to and review it.

If the user wanted to plan their holiday or post a review, they can register as a new user or login. Then they can click on the add button and fill out the required fields to create a post.

The user will then be able to edit and delete their post but will not be able to on another user's post and all users can read every post.

I have also implemented a map for the user to use. This can track your location, measure distances. I have got some information off the internet and added it onto the map for data vizulisation. The user will be able to plan (if they wanted to) visit the top 10 restaurants, attractions, and countries in the world.

## **Features**

### Existing features

On my homepage I have designed a stylish page to engage the user. I have used a Bootstrap 4 carousel with some beautiful photos.
When you scroll down I have said what the website is about and at the bottom I have created a getting started section.

The user after selling it to them can then register, then once a username has been created they will be diverted to the planner board where they can then view and share information.

Also at the bottom of the homepage the user can click on the map and also click on the planner if already a user.

Once the user has clicked on the map, one of the features is that it can track your current location, this can be vital to a user if they are in a foreign country they may get lost or you can use it to plan your journey. All the user will need to do is click on the marker on the left handside and allow the app to track your location.

You can also use the map to measure distances which can come in handy with the location tracker and measure the distances from your current location or anything else that you want to do. You can do all this by clicking on the measuring ruler on the right handside.

Also just under that you can click on the little box and you can then view your map on full screen.

Under that I have created a layer control key so a user can identify the markers on the map and then they can personalise them by unchecking the boxes.

I got the data from Google by searching top 10 restaurants, top 10 countries and top 10 attractions and I put them in a text document using their latitudes and longitudes I was able to add markers.

This will come in handy for a user whilst they are planning a trip or out and about and they want to find where is closest.
