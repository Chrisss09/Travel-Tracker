# Travel Tracker

This is my 3rd project for Data Centric Development.
This is a website to share and review your holiday experiences or you can plan where you are going to go in the future.

The user's can create, read, and share information. When the user logs into the site they can view other user's reviews - just like a trip advisor.

## **UX**

This website was made for people that like to travel and go on holiday. I have created this website so that people can create, read, update, and delete information.

The website can be used as a planner and a website to review countries. The user can add times and dates of flights, and plan key attractions on where they would like to go. You can also go back to your post and review it or you can add a new post for a country you have already been to and review it.

If the user wanted to plan their holiday or post a review, they can register as a new user or login. Then they can click on the add button and fill out the required fields to create a post.

The user will then be able to edit and delete their post but will not be able to on another user's post and all users can read every post.

I have also implemented a map for the user to use. This can track your location, measure distances. I have got some information off the internet and added it onto the map for data vizulisation. The user will be able to plan (if they wanted to) visit the top 10 restaurants, attractions, and countries in the world.
